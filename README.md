# Meat Consumption Analysis

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for analyzing meat consumption trends across various countries and regions. The analysis is based on a dataset that provides comprehensive information on meat consumption over multiple years and covers different types of meat.

## Notebooks

### 1. [Detailed Analysis by Country](path/to/meat_consumption_analysis_by_country.ipynb)

This notebook provides a detailed analysis of meat consumption trends for each country. It includes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Visualization of meat consumption trends over time for different countries and types of meat

### 2. [Statistical Analysis](path/to/meat_consumption_statistical_analysis.ipynb)

This notebook provides statistical analysis of meat consumption trends. It includes:
- Calculations of mean and standard deviation of meat consumption by country and by meat type
- Visualizations using bar plots
- Detailed trend analysis for each type of meat across different countries

### 3. [Predictive Modeling](path/to/meat_consumption_predictive_modeling.ipynb)

This notebook provides predictive modeling for forecasting future meat consumption trends using time series analysis. It includes:
- Building ARIMA models to forecast meat consumption
- Plotting historical data and forecasted trends for different countries and types of meat

### 4. [Detailed Analysis of Meat Consumption in India](path/to/meat_consumption_detailed_analysis_india.ipynb)

This notebook provides a very detailed analysis of meat consumption trends in India. It includes:
- Data preprocessing and filtering for India
- Visualization of meat consumption trends for each type of meat
- Statistical analysis (e.g., mean and standard deviation)
- Predictive modeling using ARIMA to forecast future meat consumption trends

## Dataset

The dataset used in these analyses provides comprehensive information on meat consumption across various countries and regions. It covers different types of meat and spans multiple years.

### Columns Description:
- **LOCATION**: Country or region code
- **INDICATOR**: Indicator code (e.g., meat consumption)
- **SUBJECT**: Type of meat (e.g., beef and veal, pig, poultry, sheep)
- **MEASURE**: Measurement unit (e.g., thousand tonnes of carcass weight, kilograms of retail weight per capita)
- **FREQUENCY**: Data collection frequency (e.g., annual)
- **TIME**: Year of data collection
- **Value**: Meat consumption value
- **Flag Codes**: Additional information flags

### Key Features:
- **Meat Types**: Includes data for beef and veal, pig, poultry, and sheep.
- **Measurement Units**: Meat consumption is measured in thousand tonnes of carcass weight and kilograms of retail weight per capita. Carcass weight to retail weight conversion factors are: 0.7 for beef and veal, 0.78 for pigmeat, and 0.88 for both sheep meat and poultry meat.

## Usage

These notebooks can be used for various analyses, including:
- Trends in global and regional meat consumption
- Statistical analysis of meat consumption patterns
- Predictive modeling of future meat consumption trends
